=========
Hi all FYI .
 I have created this repository for implimenting my works with agilefant backlog system. 

I have added some interesting features to agilefant on my local copy.

I would like to share those updates to the public . Sometime you may feel the codes are not good as standard, 
please revert send me your comments, that will help me to fix those in future updates.

Here is information about the lastest feature I have added to agilefant.

1. Added Comments feature .
    Now you can add your commets to each stories and tasks. 
 *. This will help you to make your stories and task more active like discussion. 
 *. You can access story comments or task comments any where you see story or task. 
 *. You can upload your attachments to each comments.

2. Attachment feature.
    Yes ., now you can add attachments to story or tasks. And I have provided administrator to controll file uploads , 
like limiting the maximum size of attachments, and number of attachments per comment ,
and administrator can configure the attachment save location. 

Attachment feature will helps you to avoid using external links.

Latet I'll add more information on this.

Thank you.
